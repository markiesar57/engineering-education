The IComparable and IComparer interfaces will be discussed in this article. Although the two interfaces sound similar, they each accomplish separate tasks. The interfaces can be used together or independently, but for sorting and comparison purposes, they operate best when they are combined. We will briefly talk about sorting and then dive into the comparison interfaces.

### An overview of sorting
Let's start with the basics of sorting. Let's assume that we wish to sort a list of integers ascendingly. The Sort function offered by Microsoft can be used because we are using Int and the built-in List.

The sorting parameter in List T>.sort is a comparator with a couple of overloads.

1. Sort() which uses the default compare strategy to sort the elements in the entire [List<T>](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-list). It sorts only elements of common types like Int and String, as shown below.
```C#
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            List<int> list = new List<int>();
            list.Add(6);
            list.Add(12);
            list.Add(18);
            list.Add(24);
            list.Sort();
            foreach(var item in list)
            {
                Console.WriteLine("Number;" + item);
            }
        }
    }
```
Output.
```bash
6
12
18
24
```
Since the Sort() is aware that it is sorting an Integer, it does so successfully in ascending order, which is why we end up having 6, 12, 18, and 24.

2. [Sort(Comparison<T>)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.comparison-1?view=net-6.0) which uses the specified System.Comparison<T> to sort the elements.
3. Sort(IComparer<T>)  which uses the specified comparer to sort all the elements in the given [List<T>](https://www.tutorialsteacher.com/csharp/csharp-list). 
4. [Sort(Int32, Int32, IComparer<T>)](https://developer.rhino3d.com/api/RhinoCommon/html/M_Rhino_Collections_RhinoList_1_Sort_4.htm) which uses the specified comparer to sort the specified range of the elements in the given List<T>. 
### Getting started with the IComparer and IComparable Interface
#### Icomparable
When you wish to compare and sort items of the same type, such as an integer and an integer or a string and a string, you use Icomparable. It can compare while sorting. To implement the IComparable interface, CompareTo must be implemented as follows:
```C#
int IComparable.CompareTo(object obj)
{
   Phone p=(Phone)obj;
   return String.Compare(this.model,p.model);
}
```
In the example above, the array contains a string therefore, we will use the method for string comparison, which is String.Compare().

#### IComparer
Icomparer gives you more options for comparison. For example, you can order your sorted array in either ascending or descending order.

When using ICompare.Compare() a tertiary comparison is usually required. We use logic operators 1, -1, and 0. We use 1 when a value is more than the value for comparison. We use 0 when a value equals the value for comparison and -1 when a value is less than the value for comparison. 

Using IComparer involves two steps. The first step is to implement the Compare method after creating an IComparer-implementing class, as shown below.
```C#
private class SortPriceAscendingHelper : IComparer
{
   int IComparer.Compare(object a, object b)
   {
      Phone p1=(Phone)a;
      Phone p2=(Phone)b;
      if (p1.price < p2.price)
         return -1;
      if (p1.price > p2.price)
         return 1;
      else
         return 0;
   }
}
```
The second step involves creating a method that returns an instance of the IComparer object as shown below.
```C#
public static IComparer SortPriceAscending()
{
   return (IComparer) new SortPriceAscendingHelper();
}
```
From the above example, we can see that objects are passed into overloaded array functions as the second argument. IComparer-compatible sort method. If you want to use IComparer, you don't have to use an array. 

### Implementing IComparable and IComparer Interfaces
The following example shows how these comparison interfaces can be put to use together. A class called Phone shows how to use IComparer and IComparable interface. When creating a phone object, model and price are two of the properties it has. The IComparable interface provides an ascending sort of the model field, while the IComparer interface provides a descending sort of the model field. IComparer provides both ascending and descending sorting of the price property.

We are first going to create the array of objects that will undergo sorting and then proceed from there, as shown below.
  
```C#
       class Program
    {
       [STAThread]
       static void Main(string[] args)
       {
          Phone[] arrayOfPhones= new Phone[6]
          {
             new Phone("Samsung Galaxy A03",11450),
             new Phone("Samsung Galaxy A12",16799),
             new Phone("Samsung Galaxy A22",22199),
             new Phone("Samsung Galaxy M31",30000),
             new Phone("Samsung Galaxy S21 Ultra",126999),
             };
            Console.WriteLine("Output Unsorted Array\n");

          foreach(Phone p in arrayOfPhones)
             Console.WriteLine(p.Model + "\t\t" + p.Price);

          Array.Sort(arrayOfPhones);
          Console.WriteLine("\n Output Array sorted by Model (Ascending - IComparable)\n");

          foreach(Phone p in arrayOfPhones)
             Console.WriteLine(p.Model + "\t\t" + p.Price);
         //Use of Icomparer on an integer
          Array.Sort(arrayOfPhones,Phone.SortPriceAscending());
          Console.WriteLine("\nOutput Array sorted by Price (Ascending - IComparer)\n");

          foreach(Phone p in arrayOfPhones)
             Console.WriteLine(p.Model + "\t\t" + p.Price);
         // Use of Icomparer in a string
         Array.Sort(arrayOfPhones,Phone.SortModelDescending());
          Console.WriteLine("\nOutput Array sorted by Model (Descending - IComparer)\n");

          foreach(Phone p in arrayOfPhones)
             Console.WriteLine(p.Model + "\t\t" + p.Price);

          Array.Sort(arrayOfPhones,Phone.SortPriceDescending());
          Console.WriteLine("\nOutput Array sorted by Price (Descending - IComparer)\n");

          foreach(Phone p in arrayOfPhones)
             Console.WriteLine(p.Model + "\t\t" + p.Price);

          Console.ReadLine();
       }
   }
```
After writing the above code, add another class to the project and call it Phone. Here we are going to create nested classes that will do the ascending and descending sort on the price property and also the model property.
We are also going to create methods that will return the Icomparer objects for the sort helper.
```C#
   public class Phone : IComparable
   {  
  // Below is the start of a Nested class to do ascending sort on the phone prices.
      private class SortPriceAscendingHelper: IComparer
      {
         int IComparer.Compare(object a, object b)
         {
            Phone p1=(Phone)a;
            Phone p2=(Phone)b;

            if (p1.price > p2.price)
               return 1;

            if (p1.price < p2.price)
               return -1;

            else
               return 0;
         }
      }
        // Below is the start of a Nested class to do a descending sort on the phone prices.                             
      private class SortPriceDescendingHelper: IComparer
      {
         int IComparer.Compare(object a, object b)
         {
            Phone p1=(Phone)a;
            Phone p2=(Phone)b;

            if (p1.price < p2.price)
               return 1;

            if (p1.price > p2.price)
               return -1;

            else
               return 0;
         }
      }
      // Below is the start of a Nested class to do descending sort on the phone model.
      private class SortModelDescendingHelper: IComparer
      {
         int IComparer.Compare(object a, object b)
         {
            Phone p1=(Phone)a;
            Phone p2=(Phone)b;
             return String.Compare(p2.model,p1.model);
         }
      }
      private string model;
      private int price;
      public Phone(string Model,int Price)
      {
         model=Model;
         price=Price;
      }
      public int Price
      {
         get  {return price;}
         set {price=value;}
      }
      public string Model
      {
         get {return model;}
         set {model=value;}
      }
      // Below we will be implementing  IComparable CompareTo to provide a default sort order.
      int IComparable.CompareTo(object obj)
      {
         Phone p=(Phone)obj;
         return String.Compare(this.model,p.model);
      }
      // Below are methods that will return the IComparer object for sort helper.
      public static IComparer SortPriceAscending()
      {
         return (IComparer) new SortPriceAscendingHelper();
      }
      public static IComparer SortPriceDescending()
      {
         return (IComparer) new SortPriceDescendingHelper();
      }
      public static IComparer SortModelDescending()
      {
        return (IComparer) new SortModelDescendingHelper();
      }
 }

```
Output.
```bash

Samsung Galaxy A12              16799
Samsung Galaxy A03              11450
```
From the above code, we have seen how IComparer is used in ascending and descending order of integer values and descending order of string values. We have also seen how Icomparable is used in sorting an array of the default sorting order.
### Difference between the IComparable and IComparer Interfaces
There is only one parameter accepted by the CompareTo method of IComparable. Because it makes a comparison between the current object and a parametrized next object. As a result, the current object CompareTo the following object. IComparer has two parameters, which is necessary because we'll be passing both objects as arguments. The method is known as "Compare," which translates as "to compare.".
  
### Conclusion
In this article, we have discussed a couple of overloads in List <T>.sort. We have also discussed the Icomparable and Icomparer interfaces and their difference. I hope this article helps you understand how to implement the two interfaces.
